      <h1>Louie the Cat</h1>
      <p>Louie is a four month old ragdoll kitten. He is super cute with a big personality. Some current facts about Louie are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>He has seal-mitted coloring <dfn>(seal indicates the color and mitted indicates the pattern)</dfn></li>
          <li>He weighs 6 lbs.</li>
          <li>He let's me know when he is hungry by meowing <strong>REALLY </strong>loudly!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Yesterday I took Louie to the vet. Afterwards, the doctor called me and said <q>Everyone in the office got to know Louie today. He was quite social.</q> I interpreted that as <i>"Louie was meowing the whole time. So much that no one in the office could ignore him!"</i></p>

      <p>Ragdolls are a special breed of cat known for their docile and friendly behavior. They don't mind being picked up by humans, and tend to just go limp and melt in your arms (hence the name ragdoll).</p>
